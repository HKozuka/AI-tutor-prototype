# AI Tutor Prototype

## What I Built

**Vocabulary Coach** – Conversational AI that teaches K-12 words through understanding, not memorization
- Explains words in kid-friendly language
- Provides memory tricks and examples
- Adapts to grade level automatically

**Math Tutor** – Socratic guide for K-12 math problem-solving
- Guides students to answers without giving them away
- Full LaTeX rendering for equations
- Encourages learning through discovery

## Tech Stack

- **Model:** GPT-4o-mini (fast, cost-effective)
- **Interface:** Gradio (easy deployment)
- **Platform:** Google Colab

## What I Learned

After building multiple prototypes, I realized the most important step comes *before* coding: **listening to users**. 

Product managers need to deeply understand teacher and student needs before architecting solutions. The best features emerge from collaboration, not assumptions.

## Files

- `AI_tutor_prototype.ipynb` – Full implementation with both chatbots

To run:

Open the notebook in Google Colab, add your OpenAI API key, and run. Both chatbots launch in minutes.
